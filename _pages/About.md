__Research interests__

Differential privacy, Trustworthy machine learning, Synthetic data, federated learning, High-dimensional statistics.

I am interested in implementing a privacy protecting machine learning algorithm and evaluating their performance. Also, the unique phenomena occuring in high-dimensional data analysis is another interest.

__Hobby__

I am currently interested in mystery novel and science fiction. My current favorite mystery novel is the museum of tricks by the seiichirō Ōyama.
